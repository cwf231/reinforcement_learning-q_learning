# Reinforcement Learning
## Learning to Checkmate with Q-Tables

This is an exploratory and training repo. My first real dive into q-learning.

1. First, I take my first steps into reinforcement learning using the python package  `gym` and their wonderful `mountain-car` environment.

2. I then dive headfirst into creating an environment, a t-table mapping, and use the strategies outlined in the first notebook to learn the basics of chess.
